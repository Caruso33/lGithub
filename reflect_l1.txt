"""Reflect: Using diff to Find Bugs"""
How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
fast
more obvious
easy
comfortable

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
learn of others
understand the evolution of the file

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
- you forget some saves and have destroyed code
+ only relevant changes saved
+ own control

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
g doc > working on single files
git > you work on separat files parallely

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
see changes in files lines

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
you can always come back to working version
